[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schell/gelatin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/schell/gelatin)

This is a mega-repo for a real-time graphics renderer in Haskell.

libraries
---------

### [gelatin (core)](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin)
* Backend definitions
* Primitives for drawing
 * triangles
 * triangle strips
 * triangle fans
 * beziers (fill below curve) + inverted beziers (fill above curve)
 * thick, feathered stroked lines and for creating new backends.
* Definitions and functions for post compilation affine transformation,
  color multiply, red channel replacement (for font textures)

### [gelatin-gl](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin-gl)
Backend for compiling `gelatin` pictures using OpenGL.

### [gelatin-freetype2](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin-freetype2)
`freetype2` text using character atlases and word maps for fast rendering. Use
this if your text changes frequently but does not often get resized. It is fast to
compile renderings but unless the text is rendered with a large character size, scaling up
the rendering will show pixels.

### [gelatin-fruity](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin-fruity)
Functions for extracting truetype font geometry as `gelatin` primitives. Use this
if your text resizes frequently but otherwise does not change. It is slow to compile
renderings but once compiled those renderings can be displayed at any scale.

### [gelatin-sdl2](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin-sdl2)
SDL2 initialization and windowing.

### [gelatin-webgl](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin-webgl)
WebGL backend via ghcjs (experimental)


examples
--------
For examples please see
[gelatin-example](https://github.com/schell/gelatin/tree/master/gelatin-example)
and
[odin](https://github.com/schell/odin)


install
-------
`gelatin` depends on

* [sdl2](http://libsdl.org)
* [freetype2](https://www.freetype.org/index.html)

You can install them with the following platform specific steps.

### Mac OS X

Using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)...

    brew install freetype
    brew install sdl2

### Ubuntu
First install freetype2

    apt-get install libfreetype6

The [sdl2 bindings](https://github.com/haskell-game/sdl2) require an sdl2
install >= 2.0.4, or for special instructions to be followed. Assuming you're
on `Ubuntu >= 16.04`, you can simply run

    apt-get install libsdl2-dev

otherwise please visit the link above and install via their README.

### Windows 10 with MSYS2/MINGW

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2


building source
---------------
The easiest way to get up and running on the Haskell toolchain is to download
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). All of gelatin's projects
are spec'd out with stack.yaml build files, so picking the correct versions of
libraries is not needed if you follow the stack path.

    git clone https://github.com/schell/gelatin.git

    cd gelatin

If you just installed stack, run

    stack setup

Go make some ☕ and then...

    stack build

Note on Windows that if you run into [this error](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/3492)

    ghc-pkg.EXE: C:\sr\snapshots\3c4ad812\pkgdb\package.cache: you don't have
    permission to modify this file

You can simply run `stack build` over and over until the thing finally compiles.
_facepalm_ - this will be fixed with ghc 8.2.

Drink your ☕, take a walk and rejoice...
